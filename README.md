# DiaBite : Cloud Computing

## üìë Description

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user input and provide personalized dietary recommendations. By combining the power of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for accurate prediction and Machine Learning (ML) for clustering dietary data, we aim to create an interactive and informative health tool. The application will leverage Gemini to provide user assistance and answer inquiries.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing

### REST API for TensorFlow Model using Flask

Implemented a REST API to process input data for diabetes risk prediction.

### REST API using Node.js and deployed to Compute Engine

Implemented a REST API to process user data for diabetes risk prediction and food recommendations. The backend integrates with Machine Learning models stored in Google Cloud Storage for real-time predictions and uses authentication endpoints with JWT for secure user access. The architecture is built on Google Cloud Platform, leveraging Compute Engine for backend deployment, Cloud SQL for database management, and Cloud Storage for handling trained ML models and user-uploaded assets.
